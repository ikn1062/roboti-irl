## Open Issues
* Change references from link format to ACA format
* Fix parameters not being loaded into launch files & need to add arguments that can be loaded from cmdline to node
* Fix the MPC to work with the cartpole simulation
* Change the controllers (ilQR / Ergodic) to use a base class - several functions are shared
* Make a better integration to run the controller
* Move files related to cartpole and running cartpole controller to the cartpole package
* Move the fourier basis and measurement initialization into the controller - easier interface

## Next steps
* Another demonstration
* Koopman?
