## Package Description
This package contains an Ergodic Library which contains a C++ implementation of a Controller, Ergodic Measurement Calculator, and an Ergodic Controller.


## C++ Script Files
### Controller
`ros2 run ergodiclib controller_test`
Generates a set of controls and the output trajectory for a given set of inputs defined in `controller_test.cpp`.

### Ergodic Controller
`ros2 run ergodiclib ergodic_main`
Generates a set of controls and the output trajectory for a given set of demonstrations and control inputs defined in `ergodic_main.cpp`.


## Python Scripts
### Cartpole Dynamics Plotter [NOT IMPLEMENTED AS A ROS2 SCRIPT YET]
`ros2 run ergodiclib visualize_ergodic.py ergodic_properties demonstration_folder`

This script generates plots of the fourier spatial mapping generated by the ergodic measurements of the demonstration trajectories.

The parameters of the `visualize_ergodic.py` are listed as follows:
* ergodic_properties (string) : File path to the ergodic properties json file
* demonstration_folder (string) : File path to the folder containing all demonstrations trajectories
