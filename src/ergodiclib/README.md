## Package Description
This package contains an Ergodic Library which contains a C++ implementation of a Controller, Ergodic Measurement Coefficient Calculator, and an Ergodic Controller. All classes and methods are under the `ergodiclib` namespace. 

Note that Doxygen documentation will be generated along side the build as part of CMake. 

## Python Scripts
### Cartpole Dynamics Plotter
`ros2 run ergodiclib visualize_ergodic.py ergodic_properties demonstration_folder`

This script generates plots of the fourier spatial mapping generated by the ergodic measurements of the demonstration trajectories.

The parameters of the `visualize_ergodic.py` are listed as follows:
* ergodic_properties (string) : File path to the ergodic properties json file
* demonstration_folder (string) : File path to the folder containing all demonstrations trajectories
