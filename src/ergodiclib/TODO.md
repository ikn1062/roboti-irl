2. Fix basis of the ergodic measure to only be in 2D (c++)


THURSDAY
- Change to use matricies in ergodic measure


- Implement ILQR Controller -> can be used as a basis for receeding horizon control
- Fix visualization tool based on basis lengths & Fourier Space (Only want to use 2D for this case)
- seperate basis from ergodic measure cpp
